For this assignment we had to create a frogger clone using the knowledge we already have. We had to 
use classes, functions, and loops. This seemed really easy at first creating the lanes, but it took
me most of the lab trying to figure out how to impliment loops with the car classes to make them look 
like the Frogger game. By the time I got to part 3 of assignment, I didn't have much time to make the 
frog or make it move. I also didn't have time to make it unique...
